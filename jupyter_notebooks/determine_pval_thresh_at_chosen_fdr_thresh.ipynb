    "# Determine P-value threshold at chosen a FDR threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we describe how to determine a P-value threshold for a given dataset so that the FDR is kept below a chosen threshold. We use an empirical method to estimate the FDR at given P-value thresholds. For a given P-value threshold ``p_thresh``, we proceed in four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the number of significant interactions ``sig_num_o`` at ``p_thresh``.\n",
    "2. Randomize the simple and twisted read pair counts of all interactions. We randomize individual interactions with $n$ read pairs by randomly drawing a simple count from a binomial distribution with $p=0.5$ and then setting the twisted count to $t=n-s$.\n",
    "3. Determine the number of randomized significant interactions ``sig_num_r`` at ``p_thresh``.\n",
    "4. Use ``sig_num_r/sig_num_o`` to estimate the FDR at ``p_thresh``.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a P-value threshold for which the FDR is kept below a chosen threshold, we estimate the FDR for increasing P-value thresholds. Then we use the P-value threshold for which the FDR is still below the chosen threshold. Note that we randomize each interaction only once and then use the same list of P-values of randomized interactions for all P-value thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the FDR grows monotonically with the P-value threshold. However, for datasets with poor signal-to-noise ratio, this may not be the case. Therefore we check this and issue a warning if applicable."
